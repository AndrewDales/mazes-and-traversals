# Mazes and traversals

Right, so the idea here was

- to take a maze in `.csv` form (with thanks to Arthur)
- to interpret the maze as a Graph in the obvious way (can't remember whether I pruned it)
- to allow user to select start and finish points
- to implement all the standard traversals

Let's take a look

# The traversals

## Breadth First

I guess we always start here

##Â Depth First

The classic

## Dijkstra

This is identical to Breadth-First in this context. Presumably I could prune and then weight the edges.
